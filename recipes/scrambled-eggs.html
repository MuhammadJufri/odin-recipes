      <li>
        In a cup or small bowl, whisk together the eggs, mayonnaise and water
        using a fork. Melt margarine in a skillet over low heat. Pour in the
        eggs, and stir constantly as they cook. Remove the eggs to a plate when
        they are set, but still moist. Do not over cook. Never add salt or
        pepper until eggs are on plate, but these are also good without.
